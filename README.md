# AmerfluxTRBiomass
Analysis of tree ring based biomass time series at Ameriflux Sites 
FILENAME: Folder: Francesc_uncertainties


     
This folder contains SITE level uncertainty estimates for sites within the DOE network.
Sites include:

Harvard Forest
Dowland Forest
Valles Lower
Valles Upper
Morgan Monroe
Missouri Ozarks
Oak Openings
UMBS-Ameriflux site
Duke Hardwood
Duke Loblolly
Savannah River
Austin-Cary
Niwot Ridge


Components included (Components from Jenkins database Table 5)

Comp. 1—total tree biomass PFT equations used
Comp. 2spp—Aboveground Biomass; Species specific equations used where possible
Comp. 2pft—Aboveground Biomass; PFT equations used
Comp. 6—Wood Biomass(stem); PFT equations used
Comp. 18—Leaves Biomass; PFT equations used
Comp. 29—Total root biomass; PFT equations used



Two file types appear:
1)Allometry Uncertainties—quantifies uncertainty associated with the parameter errors calculated with PECAN framework—https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan


2)Density Uncertainty—quantifies uncertainty associated with the variation in plot structure at the sites.

ALL BIOMASS ESTIMATES ARE IN KG/M2!!!!

All files are formatted the same:

Year: Calendar year
SiteID: General Site name—see above
Mean: Mean biomass estimate
LB: lower 95% confidence interval
UB: upper 95% confidence interval
